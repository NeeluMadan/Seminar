Thie seminar is abot describing novel approach to incorporate the prior knowledge about
the shape of organ in bio-medical images into the neural networks. Their work was
mainly inspired by initial research in shape prior and image segmentation, which is
based on PCA based active shape models and PCA based statistical models. Oktay
et. al. used their framework for the two major task mentioned below for the biomedical
image processing:
1. Image Segmentation
2. Image Super- Resolution
